    "A **function** is a block of code that is first defined, and thereafter can be called to run as many times as needed. A function might have arguments, some of which can be optional if a default value is specified.\n",

    "A function is called by parentheses: `function_name()`. Arguments are placed inside the parentehes and comma separated if there are more than one.\n",
    "Similar to `f(x, y)` from mathematics.\n",
    "\n",
    "A function can return one or more values to the caller. The values to return are put in the `return` statement. When the code hits a `return` statement the function terminates. If no `return` statement is given, the function will return `None`.\n",

    "    functions, although functions should in general be kept as simple as possible.\n",
